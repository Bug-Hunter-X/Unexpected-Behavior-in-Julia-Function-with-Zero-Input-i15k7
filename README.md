# Julia Function Bug: Zero Input Handling
This repository demonstrates a simple bug in a Julia function that arises when handling zero as an input. The function is intended to square positive numbers and negate negative numbers. However, it has unexpected behavior for a zero input.
The `bug.jl` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.jl` file demonstrates the corrected code.  The bug is in handling the edge case of the zero input.
